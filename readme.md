The code in frontend folder was made only for the ease of testing the backend and would be written completely in a different way if assignment required a UI -> as an example click  https://github.com/mtroskot/Diplomarbeit-Dreambnb/tree/master/frontend.

To run the backend, import it in eclipse and run it. When dev profile is active, test data is loaded in H2 database.
To test the backend, download the frontend, in frontend folder run:  npm install to get node modules, after the node modules are downloaded run : npm start.
